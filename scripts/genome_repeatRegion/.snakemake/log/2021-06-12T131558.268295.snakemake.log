Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 34 of /shared/liuhj/HP/scripts/HP-microevolution/scripts/genome_repeatRegion/simulateRead_blast_and_selectRepeat_region-pipeline.py:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
